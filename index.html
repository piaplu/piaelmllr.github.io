    <h3>About me</h3>
    <p>Currently I am employed as an apprentice in terms of the 'Fachinformatiker' (qualified IT specialist) apprenticeship and as a 'Informatik' (computer science) student of FOM.

I spent most of my life in Aachen, which I would call my hometown. However, I also spent a few years living in the Philippines which is my mother's country.

For my first bachelor's degree (Japanese studies and communication and media science) at Heinrich-Heine university I moved to DÃ¼sseldorf in 2016.

In my free time I love reading books, playing badminton and enjoy running. I also started practising yoga at home about a month ago.

I am very interested in getting to know more about your department and I am looking forward to working with you.</p>
